# List
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists are created using square brackets:
# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
# Changeable :The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
# Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

mylist1 = ['Bananan', 'Applle', 'Cucumber', 'Kiwi Fruit', 'Papaya', 'Cherries', 'Pinapple', 'Orange']
mylist  =  ['Papaya', 'Cherries', 'Pinapple', 'Orange']
mylistnum = [100, 87, 99 , 344 , 1 ,-1,0]
mylistnum.sort()
print(mylistnum)
